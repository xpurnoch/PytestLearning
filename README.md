# PytestLearning

**First pytest project to learn basics of unit testing, mocking, and type annotations in Python.**

This repository contains simple Python examples and corresponding tests using `pytest`. It is intended as a playground for practice and learning.

## How to run tests

Make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then run:

```bash
pytest
```

To see test coverage (if `.coverage` is present):

```bash
pytest --cov=source
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **pytest** – for unit testing
- **unittest.mock** – for mocking functions and APIs
- **mypy** – for static type checking (`.py` files are annotated)

---

## What you’ll see here

- Written unit tests for functions and classes  
- `pytest` fixtures, parameterisation, and `approx()` for floats  
- Testing object equality with `__eq__()`  
- Mock objects for HTTP requests and database access  
- Organised tests into files per feature
